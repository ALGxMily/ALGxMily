- 👋 Hey nice to meet you!
- I like to build all kind of things, started by working on front end apps while also trying out custom API solutions and using different tech stacks.
- I focus mainly on Express and nodejs stack, but I'm trying out different architectures using Redis, Postgres and RabbitMQ.
